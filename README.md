## Project ideas  
We have yet to decide on our Capstone Design project idea! but here are my project ideas. 

* **Animation assistant / Upscale animation FPS.**  
 Frame by frame drawing is still prominent technique for animation.  
 Using Video Frame Interpolation we can help to predict and create layers in between two layers/frames of animation.  
 **Objectives:**  
  - Help animators & artists to animate drawings effortlessly (Saves animators time and energy)
  - Creates smoother animations! Higher quality

* **Social Networking app to bring users together based the kinds of pictures saved in Gallery.**  
 I believe that the pictures you take are the window to your soul~  
 Based on the pictures you save, the app matches you up with people like you.  
 Suppose your gallery is filled with pictures of puppies. This app will match you up with others like you (with gallery filled with pictures of puppies).  
 **Objectives:**  
  - Help users to network, now that they have found something in common to talk about.
